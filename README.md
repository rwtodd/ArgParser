# ArgParser #

A simple argument parsing package, similar to ones I've made in Java
and C# and a few other languages.

It doesn't do much, but it covers what I need.  And, it's a nice way
to get more familiar with Swift.

## TODO ##

Perhaps in future versions, I will:

- Enhance the look of the help output (with colors/bolding)
- Add helpers to make programes with several subcommands easier.
